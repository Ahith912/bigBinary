        <p>The Hobbit is a series consisting of three high fantasy adventure films directed by Peter Jackson. The three
            films are The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey (2012), The Hobbit: The Desolation of Smaug (2013), and The
            Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies (2014).[5] The films are based on the 1937 novel The Hobbit by J. R.
            R. Tolkien, with large portions of the trilogy inspired by the appendices to The Return of the King, which
            expand on the story told in The Hobbit, as well as new material and characters written especially for the
            films. Together they act as a prequel to Jackson's The Lord of the Rings film trilogy.
            <br/>
            The screenplay was written by Fran Walsh, Philippa Boyens, Jackson, and Guillermo del Toro, who was
            originally chosen to direct before his departure from the project. The films take place in the fictional
            world of Middle-earth sixty years before the beginning of The Lord of the Rings, and follow hobbit Bilbo
            Baggins (Martin Freeman), who is convinced by the wizard Gandalf the Grey (Ian McKellen) to accompany
            thirteen dwarves, led by Thorin Oakenshield (Richard Armitage), on a quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain
            from the dragon Smaug (voiced by Benedict Cumberbatch). The films expand upon certain elements from the
            novel and other source material, such as Gandalf's investigation at Dol Guldur, and the pursuit of Azog and
            Bolg, who seek vengeance against Thorin and his kindred.</p>

        <h2>Cast</h2>
        <img src="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Martin_Freeman-5341.jpg" alt="Martin Freeman(Bilbo Baggins)"/>
        <p>Martin Freeman was cast in early October 2010 in the role of Bilbo Baggins. He had earlier turned the role
            down because of scheduling conflicts with the BBC television series Sherlock.[106] On his casting, Peter
            Jackson was quoted as saying, "Despite the various rumours and speculation surrounding this role, there has
            only ever been one Bilbo Baggins for us. There are a few times in your career when you come across an actor
            who you know was born to play a role, but that was the case as soon as I met Martin Freeman. He is
            intelligent, funny, surprising and brave—exactly like Bilbo and I feel incredibly proud to be able to
            announce that he is our Hobbit."[107]<br/><br/>

            Several other actors including Richard Armitage as Thorin Oakenshield, Graham McTavish as Dwalin, Aidan
            Turner as Kíli, Mark Hadlow as Dori, John Callen as Óin, Stephen Hunter as Bombur and Peter Hambleton as
            Glóin were cast later that October. On the casting of Armitage, Jackson was quoted as saying, "Richard is
            one of the most exciting and dynamic actors working on screen today and we know he is going to make an
            amazing Thorin Oakenshield. We cannot wait to start this adventure with him and feel very lucky that one of
            the most beloved characters in Middle Earth is in such good hands."[107] McTavish was quoted on his casting,
            "I think that I would be very lucky indeed if ever again in my career, I was offered an opportunity that was
            going to be so iconic in its influence and scale with regards to The Hobbit. I can't think of anything
            comparable."[108] On the casting of Turner, Jackson stated, "Aidan is a wonderfully gifted young actor who
            hails from Ireland. I'm sure he will bring enormous heart and humor to the role of Kíli."[109][110] On the
            casting of Hadlow, Jackson said, "I have worked with Mark Hadlow on many projects [Meet the Feebles and King
            Kong]; he is a fantastic actor. I am thrilled to be working with [him] on these movies."[109][110] Hadlow
            also plays Bert the Stone-troll. Callen stated, "I did wonder about my casting and how they had made the
            choice—maybe the long hair and the beard sold it, I thought. But now that has all gone. Given that Óin is
            almost 200 years old I can presume only that it was the age."[111] Hunter said, "Being cast in The Hobbit is
            really exciting and really an honour. I auditioned for the original Lord of the Rings way back when I signed
            with my agent in New Zealand. When I saw the films I thought, 'Man, I so want to do The Hobbit.'"[112]<br/>

            James Nesbitt and Adam Brown were added to the cast in November 2010 to play Bofur and Ori
            respectively.[113] It was previously reported that Nesbitt was in negotiations for a part in the film.[114]
            Jackson said "James's charm, warmth and wit are legendary as is his range as an actor in both comedic and
            dramatic roles. We feel very lucky to be able to welcome him as one of our cast."[113] Nesbitt's daughters
            also appear in the film series as Sigrid and Tilda, the daughters of Bard the Bowman.[105] Jackson said
            "Adam is a wonderfully expressive actor and has a unique screen presence. I look forward to seeing him bring
            Ori to life."[113] The role was Brown's first film appearance.[115]<br/>
            <br/>

            Cate Blanchett, Sylvester McCoy, Mikael Persbrandt, William Kircher, Ken Stott, and Jed Brophy were cast in
            December as Galadriel, Radagast the Brown, Beorn, Bifur, Balin, and Nori, respectively.[116] Blanchett was
            the first returning cast member from The Lord of the Rings film trilogy to be cast in the films, even though
            her character does not appear in the novel. On her casting, Jackson said, "Cate is one of my favorite actors
            to work with and I couldn't be more thrilled to have her reprise the role she so beautifully brought to life
            in the earlier films."[116] McCoy, the former Doctor Who star, who appeared alongside McKellen in a Royal
            Shakespeare Company's King Lear, was confirmed to be in negotiations to play a major role as a "wizard" in
            October 2010,[117] leading to speculation he could appear as Radagast the Brown.[118] During the production
            of The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, McCoy had been contacted about playing the role of Bilbo and was kept
            in place as a potential Bilbo for six months before Jackson went with Ian Holm.[119] On the casting of
            Persbrandt, Jackson was quoted as saying, "The role of Beorn is an iconic one and Mikael was our first
            choice for the part. Since seeing him read for the role we can't imagine anyone else playing this
            character."[116] On the casting of Stott, Jackson commented "Fran and I have long been fans of Ken's work
            and are excited he will be joining us on this journey."[116] The casting of Brophy came after his
            collaboration with Jackson on several films, including Braindead, Heavenly Creatures, and all three Lord of
            the Rings films as various creatures.</p>

        <h2>Filming</h2>
        <p>Principal photography began on 21 March 2011 in Wellington, New Zealand. Filming took place at Wellington
            Stone Street Studios, the town of Matamata and at other undisclosed locations around New Zealand.[155]

            The costumes for each of the Dwarves included six wigs and eight beards, which were worn by the actors,
            stunt doubles, and stand-ins.[156]

            During July 2011, scenes from The Hobbit were filmed at Pinewood Studios, England. Sets were constructed on
            the F and N&P Stages for the shoot.[157] Jackson recorded a video blog from the set, which featured
            Christopher Lee in full makeup and costume as Saruman.[157][158] All the scenes with Christopher Lee as
            Saruman were shot in that studio, as he was unable to travel to New Zealand.[159] The Saruman scenes
            actually in New Zealand were shot with a body double. The scenes with Ian Holm as Bilbo Baggins were
            similarly shot in Pinewood Studios; Martin Freeman doubles as old Bilbo Baggins in one scene.[160]<br/><br/>

            The second block of shooting in New Zealand began at the end of August and was completed in December
            2011.[161]

            Principal photography ended on 6 July 2012, after 266 days of filming.[162]

            During May 2013, additional filming for the second and third films began in New Zealand and lasted for 10
            weeks.</p>

        <h2>Post Production</h2>
        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>The music of The Hobbit film series was composed, produced and (in the case of the first film) orchestrated
            and conducted by Howard Shore, who scored all three The Lord of the Rings films. Recording sessions for the
            first film began on 20 August 2012, at Abbey Road Studios.[187] The second and third films were recorded in
            New Zealand.[188]

            Unlike with the Lord of the Rings, which only received an expanded release after 2005, each Hobbit
            soundtrack was released in a two-CD, two-hour release. The music features 64-70 new leitmotives, about 40
            leitmotives returning from The Lord of the Rings, and a variety of non-orchestral instruments, including
            bagpipes, didgeridoos and a whole Gamelan orchestra.[189]<br/><br/>

            The score for An Unexpected Journey was primarily played by the London Philharmonic Orchestra (as it was for
            The Lord of the Rings), London Voices and Tiffin' Boys choir, although Jackson and Shore chose the New
            Zealand Symphony Orchestra (which participated in scoring a large section of the Fellowship of the Ring) to
            score The Desolation of Smaug and The Battle of the Five Armies. Additional musicians, including two gamelan
            orchestras, and the London Voices and Tiffin' boys choir, augmented the orchestra. Musicians Neil Finn and
            Ed Sheeran contributed to the score as well as some actors including Richard Armitage and the cast of
            dwarves, James Nesbitt and Barry Humphries (in the extended edition).[190] Clara Sanabras[191] and Grace
            Davidson[192] sang the soprano parts.</p>
